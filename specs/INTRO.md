# __SEEP__
### Introduction to the protocol

Any business needs to share information and commuincate with other players in the world to produce value. As of today there are many standard definition of what the content of transactions may be: ANSI X12, UN/EDIFACT, EANCOMM, etcetera, they all provide a wrap for information content that lets uderstand and interpret datas. The so called EDI standards usually provide a long list of rules to compile a text file that can be handled by the parties involved, but before the actual transaction takes place a non documented process have to be done to define a communication channel (X400, AS2, HTTPS are the most used). 
This may require both parties a team of people to integrate the existing communication infrastructure with the new partner.

A standard process needs to be defined: a software able to handle this standard will replace the communication integration in a predictable way, leaving the team of people time to do more valuable activities and handle only exception occurring here and in the process.
The use of SEEP as a functional communication protocol will enable the continuation of the existing way of exchanging data and will let users define their own formats: as an example Alice Inc. and BobGmbh may decide to exchange database items directly instead of implementing a two-way translation  to speak the same language (Alice format to standard, standard to Bob format).

Having understood this, you may now read the full protocol specifications.
